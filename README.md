# IterativeQuickSort
Non-recursive version of Quicksort incorporating the median of three rule to determine the pivot key.

Quick Sort uses a Pivot value to arrange all numbers greater than the pivot on one side and all values smaller than the pivot on the other side. Pivot 
“Median of three” rule uses the median of the first last and the middle elements of the array as the Pivot so that we avoid the chance of picking the smallest or the largest element in the array. This is done for better performancy than using the first, last or any other element.
